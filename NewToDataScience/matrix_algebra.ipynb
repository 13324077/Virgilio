    " - want to see how matrices work\n",
    " - want to implement a basic Python library to deal with matrices\n",

    "Conversely, I would not classify this as the best resource for you if\n",

    " - you want to learn the deep insights of how matrices work and why they work the way they do\n",
    " - you want to get a nice knowledge of linear algebra: matrices are just a part of linear algebra, not the whole thing!\n",

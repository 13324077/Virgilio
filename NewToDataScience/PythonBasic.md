# Basic Python

## Scope and outcome of this guide

Hi, I'm Virgilio, but you probably already know me.\
Why do I want you to learn Python? 

According to Sun Tzu:
> If you don't know Python, learn it yesterday!

Python is simple to understand, is simple to read, is powerful and flexible, can help you in everyday tasks (even if you're not a progammer!) and automatize a lot of boring stuffs. Moreover, is the core Data Science tool, and most of the frameworks we'll need in the next guides are written in Python or have rich Python wrappers. What are you waiting for?

This guide will take you _from zero coding knowledge_ to a solid Python skill and a complete awareness of the most important concepts in programming. 

After this basic path, you'll be prepared to tackle the more advanced topics! 

I'm not going to re-invent the wheel so, for our purposes, [**THIS**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) free book is the perfect choice.
I'm going  to explore each of the chapter of the book, and for each one, I want you to read the entire chapter from the book and challenge yourself with the exercise I'll suggest you.

We're gonna install Python (the interpreter of the code you will write) and Pycharm (a development environment that will semplify your coding life).

First, let's [install Python 3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on our machine!
[Here](http://keyseronline.net/TGC/PythonInstallInstructions.pdf) you have in-depth guide on how install Python and Pycharm on every operating system.

Now you're ready to go!

## Prerequisites
Time, will to learn, and curiosity :)\
Nothing else!

## Introduction
Some people may say that Python isn't the best programming language for newcomers in coding, because is a really [high level](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/high-low-level-languages) language - that is, you don't have to take care about a lot of boring things under the hood, and you can just _focus on what you need_ from programming.\
This reason can be okay if you're studying to be a developer, in that case starting from more traditional languages like C or Java can be the right choice. But taking into account how many people come from different fields and just want to be able to apply programming to their specific problems, I think they don't want to suffer headache because of broken pointers or Capital letters in the Java class names. Moreover, Data Science is a trasversal and "high level" field, so Python is definitely the best choice to start with.     

The first thing you want to do is to read the [**Chapter 0**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/) of our book. It's a nice introduction about what is programming and why is damn useful.

[Here](http://www.bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/why-learn-python) you have another bunch of reason why Python is the best choice for start learning programming. 

## Python Basics
As you can see, one of the most loved aspects of Python is the syntax.
Python [was born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) thinking "I want a programming language that is as close as possible to the plain English". So, most of the times, when you don't know the name of something, just try to think about the plain literal english name of that thing, and probably the Python name will be that one!  

Before diving in the Python Syntax basics, I want you to read [this](https://dev.to/lucpattyn/basic-programming-concepts-for-beginners-2o73) introduction to basic programming concepts. If you're a total beginner go there, if not you can skip it.

Now take your time and read the [**Chapter 1**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/) of the book. Be sure to understand each step, but it won't hard probably. Here you'll become confident with basic arithmetic operations and data types.

[Here](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/) you find a deeper overview of data types, and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html) you find the data types section of the [**official Python documentation**](https://docs.python.org/3.7/).
Starting walking around the documentation as a begineer is a really good practice, even if a lot of things will be unclear. In fact be able to explore the documentation of something is the key to learn it autonomously.
[Here](http://blog.techtalentsouth.com/8-tips-to-reading-documentation-a-newbies-guide) you have some tips to read documentations effectively.

Until now we've scratched just the surface of the Python power: the next step is to understant the Flow Control, one of the most important concepts of programming.

## Flow Control 
You control the flow of you program with conditions and loops.

An **if statement** verifies a condition, that can be True or False, and provides a different behavior for the two cases.
If the condition is True, the program will execute the lines inside the If, otherwise it will simply skip them.

>**If**  Virgilio  **is** awesome......
>> Print Ciao!

The If statement above, written in Python, becomes:
> If Virgilio == "awesome":
>> Print("Ciao!")

It can have an optional **else statement**, to specify what to do if the condition is False. 

As you can see, Python is really similar to plain English.

In this chapter of the book you'll also find **loops**.\

You can go now with the [**Chapter 2**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/) of the book. Flow control is one the of the most core concepts of programming, so be sure of understanding it.

_Challenge yourself_: 
- [Here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-conditional-statements-and-loop-exercises.php) you have more or less 20 exercises about flow control. Be sure of tackling them all before going on.

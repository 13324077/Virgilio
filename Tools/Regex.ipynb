    "## What is a regex?\n",
    "[**Regex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) stands for _regular expression_, and regular expressions are a way of writing patterns that match strings. Usually these patterns can be used to search strings for specific things, or to search and then replace certain things, etc. Regular expressions are great for string manipulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do regular expressions matter?\n",
    "From the first paragraph in this guide you might have guessed it, but regular expressions can be very useful **whenever you have to deal with strings**. From the basic renaming of a set of similarly named variables in your source code to [data preprocessing](https://github.com/clone95/Virgilio/blob/master/Specializations/HardSkills/DataPreprocessing.md). Regular expressions usually offer a concise way of expressing whatever type of things you want to find. For example, if you wanted to parse a form and look for the year that someone might have been born in, you could use something like `(19)|(20)[0-9][0-9]`. This is an example of a regular expression!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This guide does not assume any prior knowledge. Examples will be coded in Python, but mastery of the programming language is neither assumed nor needed. You are welcome to read the guide in your browser or to download it and to run the examples/toying around with them.\n",

    "A regex is just a string written in a certain format, that can then be used by specific tools/libraries/programs to perform pattern matching on strings. Throughout this guide we will use `this formatting` to refer to regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest regular expressions that one can create are just composed of regular characters. If you wanted to find all the occurrences of the word _\"Virgilio\"_ in a text, you could write the regex `Virgilio`. In this regular expression, no character is doing anything special or different. In fact, this regular expression is just a normal word. That is ok, regular expressions are strings, after all!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were given the text _\"Project Virgilio is great\"_, you could use your `Virgilio` regex to find the occurrence of the word _\"Virgilio\"_. However, if the text was _\"Project virgilio is great\"_, then your regex wouldn't work, because regular expressions are **case-sensitive** by default and thus should match everything exactly. We say that `Virgilio` matches the sequence of characters \"Virgilio\" literally."

He wrote three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid. A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, are sometimes attributed to him.[2][3]\n",

Virgil's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine Comedy, in which Virgil appears as Dante's guide through Hell and Purgatory.\n",

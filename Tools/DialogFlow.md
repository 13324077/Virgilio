# ChatBots with DialogFlow, Python and Flask

## What is a ChatBot 
In simple terms, a [Chatbot](https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-a-chatbot-and-how-to-use-it-for-your-business-976ec2e0a99f) is a computer program that simulates human conversation (in the form of texts and audio) 
which we would perceive as being intelligent. 
Chatbots have the ability to _dig through huge amounts of data_ to pick out
the best nugget for a customer, weather it is a troubleshooting solution or a recommendation for a
new product to try. Also, they offer a extremely _intuitive interface_ between your business and you customers.
Depending on the situation, a chatbot can learn from what a user
says to personalize the interaction and build off previous interaction, giving 
a [satisfying and futuristic customer experience](https://mobilemonkey.com/chatbots/chatbot-examples).

## Why Dialogflow
[DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) is the beginner friendly chatbot platform from mother Google, and albeit there are several platforms out 
there ([here](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/choosing-the-best-chatbot-platform-101-a-beginners-guide-e841b41192c7) a cool guide on choosing the right 
platforms), DialogFlow has the best tradeoffs in particular for a beginner. [Here](https://chatbotsjournal.com/25-chatbot-platforms-a-comparative-table-aeefc932eaff) you find 
another comparative table.
I've chosen DialogFlow because:
- Incorporates Google's machine learning expertise and products such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
- Is a Google service that runs on Google Cloud Platform, letting you scale to hundreds of millions of users.
- Is really beginner-friendly, intuitive, and has a complete and clear documentation.
  
## Prerequisites 
This guide will use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and his [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) lightweight library to let you build a complete and deployable 
chatbot application. So, if you don't know Python, make yourself a gift and [learn it!](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
